			<title>Using the shutdown Command</title>
			<p>If you are using persistent regions, (members are persisting data to disk), you
				should use the <codeph>gfsh</codeph>
				<codeph>shutdown</codeph> command to stop the running system in an orderly fashion.
				This command synchronizes persistent partitioned regions before shutting down, which
				makes the next startup of the distributed system as efficient as possible. </p>
			<p>If possible, all members should be running before you shut them down so
				synchronization can occur. Shut down the system using the following
					<codeph>gfsh</codeph> command: <codeblock>gfsh&gt;shutdown</codeblock> By
				default, the shutdown command will only shut down data nodes. If you want to shut
				down all nodes including locators, specify the
					<codeph>--include-locators=true</codeph> parameter. For example:
				<codeblock>gfsh>shutdown --include-locators=true</codeblock>This will shut down all
				locators one by one, shutting down the manager last.</p>
			<p>To shutdown all data members after a grace period, specify a time-out option (in
				seconds). <codeblock>gfsh&gt;shutdown --time-out=60</codeblock> To shutdown all
				members including locators after a grace period, specify a time-out option (in
				seconds).<codeblock>gfsh>shutdown --include-locators=true --time-out=60</codeblock></p>

			<title>Shutting Down System Members Individually</title>
			<p>If you are not using persistent regions, you can shut down the distributed system by
				shutting down each member in the reverse order of their startup. (See <xref
					href="starting_up.xml" type="concept" format="dita" scope="local"
					><?xm-replace_text Starting Up Your System?></xref> for the recommended order of
				member startup.) </p>
			<p>Shut down the distributed system members according to the type of member. For
				example, use the following mechanisms to shut down members: <ul
					id="ul_12CC69DA7B8047AFA69CC5F120B66E0F">
					<li id="li_0C4894CD078B469A869B008331A4FF99">Use the appropriate mechanism to
						shut down any <keyword keyref="product_name"/>-connected client applications
						that are running in the distributed system. </li>
					<li id="li_534EF2BF81C74B2EB40A3322AD9B8BB3">Shut down any cache servers. To shut down a
						server, issue the following <codeph>gfsh</codeph> command:
						<codeblock>gfsh&gt;stop server --name=&lt;...&gt;</codeblock>or
						<codeblock>gfsh>stop server --dir=&lt;server_working_dir></codeblock>
					</li>
					<li id="li_3BA78A549F184817943F53786FF2CEDE">Shut down any locators. To shut down a locator,
						issue the following <codeph>gfsh</codeph> command:
						<codeblock>gfsh&gt;stop locator --name=&lt;...&gt;</codeblock>
						or<codeblock>gfsh>stop locator --dir=&lt;locator_working_dir></codeblock></li>

			<title>Option for System Member Shutdown Behavior</title>
			<p>The <codeph>DISCONNECT_WAIT</codeph> command line argument sets the maximum time for
				each individual step in the shutdown process. If any step takes longer than the
				specified amount, it is forced to end. Each operation is given this grace period, so
				the total length of time the cache member takes to shut down depends on the number
				of operations and the <codeph>DISCONNECT_WAIT</codeph> setting. During the shutdown
				process, <keyword keyref="product_name"/> produces messages such as:
				<codeblock>Disconnect listener still running</codeblock>The
					<codeph>DISCONNECT_WAIT</codeph> default is 10000 milliseconds. </p>
			<p>To change it, set this system property on the Java command line used for member
				startup. For example:
				<codeblock>gfsh&gt;start server --J=-DDistributionManager.DISCONNECT_WAIT=&lt;milliseconds&gt;</codeblock>
				Each process can have different <codeph>DISCONNECT_WAIT</codeph> settings. </p>
