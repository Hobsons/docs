			<p>Start server-distributed systems before you start their client applications. In each
				distributed system, follow these guidelines for member startup: <ul
					id="ul_5863AF9CB6DB436E81D974ACA90A4C11">
					<li id="li_FD023619751949E883BE95DFA93888FF">Start locators first. See <xref
							href="running_the_locator.xml" type="concept"
							format="dita" scope="local"/> for examples of locator startup commands. </li>
					<li id="li_F6AFBB5A5A954FCAB0AEDD40C5B13B66">Start cache servers before the rest
						of your processes unless the implementation requires that other processes be
						started ahead of them. <xref
							href="running_the_cacheserver.xml"
							type="concept" format="dita" scope="local"/> for examples of server
						startup commands. </li>
					<li id="li_533E8FB3517845899892FCD816A3A6A4">If your distributed system uses
						both persistent replicated and non-persistent replicated regions, you should
						start up all the persistent replicated members in parallel before starting
						the non-persistent regions. This way, persistent members will not delay
						their startup for other persistent members with later data. </li>
					<li id="li_BCFA0D08977B49CB84928EBEE322764D">If you are running producer
						processes and consumer or event listener processes, start the producers
						first. This ensures the consumers and listeners receive all notifications
						and updates. </li>
					<li>If you are starting up your locators and peer members all at once, you can
						use the <codeph>locator-wait-time</codeph> property (in seconds) upon
						process start up. This timeout allows peers to wait for the locators to
						finish starting up before attempting to join the distributed system. If a
						process has been configured to wait for a locator to start, it will log an
						info-level message<lq><codeph>GemFire startup was unable to contact a
							locator. Waiting for one to start. Configured locators are
							frodo[12345],pippin[12345]. </codeph></lq>The process will then
						sleep for a second and retry until it either connects or the number of
						seconds specified in <codeph>locator-wait-time</codeph> has elapsed. By
						default, <codeph>locator-wait-time</codeph> is set to zero meaning that a
						process that cannot connect to a locator upon startup will throw an
						exception.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<note>You can optionally override the default timeout period for shutting down individual
				processes. This override setting must be specified during member startup. See <xref
					href="shutting_down.xml#concept_47C4C4F5E59948B694B394B0A57C5ECC/section_7CF680CF8A924C57A7052AE2F975DA81"/>

				disk store files. If you lose disk store files, your next startup may hang, waiting
				for the lost disk stores to come back online. If your system hangs at startup, use
				the <codeph>gfsh</codeph> command <codeph>show missing-disk-store</codeph> to list
				missing disk stores and, if needed, revoke missing disk stores so your system
				startup can complete. You must use the Disk Store ID to revoke a disk store. These
				are the two commands:
				<codeblock>
gfsh&gt;show missing-disk-stores

           Disk Store ID             |   Host    |               Directory
