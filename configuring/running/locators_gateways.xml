	<title>Locators, Gateway Receivers, and Ports</title>
	<shortdesc>The ephemeral port range and TCP port range for locators must be accessible to
		members through the firewall. The full range of port values for gateway receivers also must

		<p>Locators are used in the peer-to-peer cache to discover other processes. They can be used
			by clients to locate servers as an alternative to configuring clients with a collection
			of server addresses and ports. </p>
		<p>Locators have a TCP/IP port that all members must be able to connect to. They also start
			a distributed system and so need to have their ephemeral port range and TCP port
			accessible to other members through the firewall. </p>
		<p>Clients need only be able to connect to the locator's locator port. They don't interact
			with the locator's distributed system; clients get server names and ports from the
			locator and use these to connect to the servers. For more information, see <xref
				href="running_the_locator.xml" type="concept" format="dita"
