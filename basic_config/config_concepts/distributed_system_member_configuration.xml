			<title>Distributed System Membership and System Topologies</title>
			<p>Every <keyword keyref="product_name"/> process is a member of a distributed system,
				even if the distributed system is defined as standalone, with just one member. You
				can run an individual distributed system in isolation or you can combine systems for
				vertical and horizontal scaling. See <xref
					href="../../topologies_and_comm/topology_concepts/chapter_overview.xml"/>. <ul
					id="ul_D86A9A00CCBA4217BFF3E60948BC0A8B">
					<li id="li_D26747B1FB3947279105414165979447"><b>Peer-to-Peer Distributed
							Systems</b>. Members that define the same member discovery properties
						belong to the same distributed system and are peers to one another. </li>
					<li id="li_58030CD703274E5AB4D1FA032D8F4042"><b>Client/Server Installations</b>.
						The client/server topology uses relationships that you configure between
						members of multiple distributed systems. You configure some or all of the
						peers in one distributed system to act as cache servers to clients
						connecting from outside the system. Each server can host many client
						processes, managing cache access for all in an efficient, vertically
						hierarchical cache configuration. You configure the client applications to
						connect to the servers, using a client cache configuration. Clients run as
						members of standalone <keyword keyref="product_name"/> distributed systems,
						with no peers, so all data updates and requests go to the servers. </li>
