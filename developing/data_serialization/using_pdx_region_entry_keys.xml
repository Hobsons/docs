	<title>Using PDX Objects as Region Entry Keys</title>
	<shortdesc>Using PDX objects as region entry keys is highly discouraged. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>

			<p> The best practice for creating region entry keys is to use a simple key; for
				example, use a String or Integer. If the key must be a domain class, then you should
				use a non-PDX-serialized class. </p>
			<p>If you must use PDX serialized objects as region entry keys, ensure that you do not
				set <codeph>read-serialized</codeph> to <codeph>true</codeph>. This configuration
				setting will cause problems in partitioned regions because partitioned regions
				require the hash code of the key to be the same on all JVMs in the distributed
				system. When the key is a <codeph>PdxInstance</codeph> object, its hash code will
				likely not be the same as the hash code of the domain object. </p>
			<p>If you are using PDX serialized objects as region entry keys and you are using
				persistent regions, then you must configure your PDX disk store to be a different
				one than the disk store used by the persistent regions. See <xref
					href="persist_pdx_metadata_to_disk.xml"
					type="concept" format="dita" scope="local"/> for information on setting up a PDX
				disk store. </p>
