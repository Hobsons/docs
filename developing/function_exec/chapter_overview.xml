	<title>Function Execution</title>
	<shortdesc> A function is a body of code that resides on a server and that an application can
		invoke from a client or from another server without the need to send the function code
		itself. The caller can direct a data-dependent function to operate on a particular dataset,
		or can direct a data-independent function to operate on a particular server, member, or
		member group.</shortdesc>

		<section id="section_CBD5B04ACC554029B5C710CE8E244FEA">The function execution service provides
			solutions for a variety of use cases, including: <ul

				<li>An application needs to perform an operation on the data associated with a key.
					A registered server-side function can retrieve the data, operate on it, and put
					it back, with all processing performed locally to the server.</li>
				<li id="li_C19A58298C5C4CFA9E86E17963C0D02A">An application needs to initialize some
					of its components once on each server, which might be used later by executed
					functions. </li>
				<li id="li_22B405A0EACF45E2B8832355349D9D85">A third-party service, such as a
					messaging service, requires initialization and startup. </li>
				<li id="li_D9D5CC17617D4001A54D70BD506876F6">Any arbitrary aggregation operation
					requires iteration over local data sets that can be done more efficiently
					through a single call to the cache server. </li>
				<li id="li_33796010E69D4F8D9D268CE566FADF11">An external resource needs provisioning
					that can be done by executing a function on a server. </li>
