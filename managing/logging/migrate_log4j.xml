    <title>Migrating to Log4j 2</title>
    <shortdesc>Beginning in Pivotal GemFire 8.1, GemFire now supports Apache Log4j 2 for use as
        GemFire's logging system. If you are upgrading your applications from an older version of
        GemFire, perform these steps to migrate to Log4j 2.</shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>This procedure describes how to move from the existing GemFire LogWriter API logging
                system to using <xref
                    href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/"
                    format="html"
                    scope="external">Apache Log4j 2</xref> for your GemFire application logging. If
                you do not perform these steps, then GemFire will by default use the existing,
                legacy LogWriter APIs.</p>
