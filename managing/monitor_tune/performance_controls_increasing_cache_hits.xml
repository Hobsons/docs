	<title>Increasing the Ratio of Cache Hits</title>
	<shortdesc>The more frequently a get fails to find a valid value in the first cache and has to
		try a second cache, the more the overall performance is affected. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p> A common cause of misses is expiration or eviction of the entry. If you have a regionâ€™s
			entry expiration or eviction enabled, monitor the region and entry statistics. </p>
		<p>If you see a high ratio of misses to hits on the entries, consider increasing the
			expiration times or the maximum values for eviction, if possible. See <xref
				href="../../developing/eviction/chapter_overview.xml" format="dita"
				><?xm-replace_text Eviction?></xref> for more information. </p>
